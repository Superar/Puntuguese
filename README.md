# Puntuguese - A Corpus of Puns in Portuguese with Micro-editions

Puntuguese is a corpus of punning texts in Portuguese, including jokes in Brazilian and European Portuguese. The data has been manually gathered and curate according to our [guidelines](data/GUIDELINES.md). It also contains some layers of annotation:

- Every pun is classified as homophonic, homographic, both, or none according to their specific punning signs;
- The punning and alternative signs were made explicit for every joke;
- We also mark potentially problematic puns from an ethical perspective, so it is easier to filter them out if needed.

Additionally, every joke in the corpus has a non-humorous counterpart, obtained via micro-editing, to enable Machine Learning systems to be trained.

In this paper, we introduce Puntuguese, a new corpus of punning humor in Portuguese, motivated by previous works showing that currently available corpora for this language are still unfit for Machine Learning due to data leakage. Puntuguese comprises 4,903 manually-gathered punning one-liners in Brazilian and European Portuguese. To create negative examples that differ exclusively in terms of funniness, we carried out a micro-editing process, in which all jokes were edited by fluent Portuguese speakers to make the texts unfunny. Finally, we did some experiments on Humor Recognition, showing that Puntuguese is considerably more difficult than the previous corpus, achieving an F1-Score of 68.9{\%}. With this new dataset, we hope to enable research not only in NLP but also in other fields that are interested in studying humor; thus, the data is publicly available.",
