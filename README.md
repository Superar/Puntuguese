# Puntuguese - A Corpus of Puns in Portuguese with Micro-editions

Puntuguese is a corpus of punning texts in Portuguese, including jokes in Brazilian and European Portuguese. The data has been manually gathered and curate according to our [guidelines](data/GUIDELINES.md). It also contains some layers of annotation:

- Every pun is classified as homophonic, homographic, both, or none according to their specific punning signs;
- The punning and alternative signs were made explicit for every joke;
- We also mark potentially problematic puns from an ethical perspective, so it is easier to filter them out if needed.

Additionally, every joke in the corpus has a non-humorous counterpart, obtained via micro-editing, to enable Machine Learning systems to be trained.
