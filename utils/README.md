# Utility Scripts

In the BRHuM project, we used some utility scripts:

- `fix-ids.py` -- Fix pun IDs to make them unique and numbered in order.
- `remove_duplicates.py` -- Remove duplicated puns in a new JSON file that are already in the corpus.
- `create_classification_corpus.py` -- Combine corpus and edition files into a single classification JSON corpus.
- `create_csv_table.py` -- Turn the JSON corpus file into a CSV file, easier to import into a spreadsheet.
